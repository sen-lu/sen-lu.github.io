<p><a href="http://frompointa.org/">Point A</a> is working to create a network of ambitious and engaged income-sharing egalitarian urban communes as a starting point on the road to a more humane, satisfying, and sustainable world for all. Point A is a project of the <a href="http://www.thefec.org/">Federation of Egalitarian Communities (FEC)</a>.</p>

<p>The Point A project in New York is affiliated with <a href="http://smiling-hogshead-ranch.tumblr.com/become-a-member">Smiling Hogshead Ranch</a>, an autonomous, all-volunteer urban farm. After two years of organizing that I joined onto in May 2017, Point A successfully founded an urban commune in Astoria, Queens, New York City.</p>

<h4 id="penn-haven-housing-co-operative">Penn Haven Housing Co-operative</h4>

<p>Established in 2011, Penn Haven Housing Co-operative (PHHC) is a vegan cooperative living community committed to social justice and sustainability. PHHC is committed to making decisions by consensus, living consciously, and working to create a safe, affordable, and welcoming space for student-aged individuals in the Philadelphia area.</p>

<p>I was a member of Penn Haven Housing Co-operative for two and a half years, from August 2012 till December 2015, and have held multiple roles including Mediator, Treasurer and Bulk Purchaser.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHHC’s Values</p>

<h4 id="v-day">V-Day</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vdayupenn.org/">V-Day College Campaign</a> is one of the largest and most successful social justice movements on the University of Pennsylvania’s campus. V-Day UPenn has become the catalyst for mobilizing both women and men to heighten awareness of violence against women of all ages, as well as the force that empowers individuals and the public-at-large to bring that violence to an end.</p>

<p>The campaign puts on an annual benefit production of Eve Ensler’s play, <em>The Vagina Monologues</em>, which reaches over 4,000 students, alumni, faculty, staff, and residents. Over the past seven years, V-Day UPenn has raised over $290,000 for its beneficiary, Women Organized Against Rape (WOAR), the only full-service rape crisis center in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I was a member of the Associate Board from 2014 - 2015, working to raise campaign awareness and supporting efforts to make the movement more inclusive of transgender women.</p>

<p>Hosted by Penn Violence Prevention at the University of Pennsylvania, Student Anti-Violence Advocate (SAVA) training is an interactive 6-hour training that educates students about the prevalence and impact of sexual violence, relationship violence and stalking. It provides them with the skills to recognize and respond to interpersonal violence if they, or a friend, experiences it and prepares them to be an active bystander combating violence on campus.</p>

<p>I underwent SAVA training in 2013 and subsequently led anti-violence trainings in student groups, such as the co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega.</p>

<p>Cesium serves terrain imagery via graphical map tiles served by various imagery providers (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Bing, Mapbox).

I abstracted specific imagery provider classes (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">OpenStreetMapImageryProvider</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">TileMapServiceImageryProvider</code>) to inherit functionality from a generic <code class="highlighter-rouge">UrlTemplateImageryProvider</code>.</p>

<h3 id="textual-interpretation">Textual Interpretation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Science is still one of my chief joys. The popularization of science that Isaac Asimov did so well—the communication not just of the findings but of the methods of science—seems to me as natural as breathing. After all, when you’re in love, you want to tell the world.</p>

  <p>– Carl Sagan, <a href="https://www.csicop.org/si/show/wonder_and_skepticism">“Wonder and Skepticism”</a>, Skeptical Inquirer 19 (1), January-February 1995, <a href="http://worldcat.org/issn/0194-6730">ISSN 0194-6730</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I transcribed Carl Sagan’s <a href="https://www.csicop.org/si/show/wonder_and_skepticism">“Wonder and Skepticism”</a> into a textual interpretation, which I printed using laser-cut linoleum blocks on a linotype machine.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/assets/images/text-printed.jpg" alt="" />

<p>As a fun side note, here’s an additional excerpt from Sagan’s piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s another reason I think popularizing science is important, why I try to do it. It’s a foreboding I have—maybe ill-placed—of an America in my children’s generation, or my grandchildren’s generation, when all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when we’re a service and information-processing economy; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest even grasps the issues; when the people (by “the people” I mean the broad population in a democracy) have lost the ability to set their own agendas, or even to knowledgeably question those who do set the agendas; when there is no practice in questioning those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and religiously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in steep decline, unable to distinguish between what’s true and what feels good, we slide, almost without noticing, into superstition and darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was published in 1995. It’s a little terrifying to think about this in context of current events, but also heartening to see how my research interests and skills have grown so organically over the past five years. I feel just as passionate about working to counteract this version of reality, and infinitely more prepared to go out into the world and do it.</p>

<h3 id="personal-logo">Personal Logo</h3>

<p>During a 2012 Graphic Design class at the University of Pennsylvania, I was tasked with creating a personal logo. I first collected <strong>external inspiration</strong>:
<img src="/assets/images/logo-inspiration.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then conducted <strong>internal reflection</strong>:
<img src="/assets/images/myself.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I integrated this inspiration with my initials (TL) to make the following shape:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/logo-bg.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While it conveyed the clean, bold aesthetic and sense of movement I was aiming for, it lacked grounding and was too sharp and static. I wanted to impart a sense of continuity, a shape that existed both in and outside of itself. My final product is the personal logo I still use today:</p>

2012, ZONING, Adobe Photoshop and InDesign</p>

<p>Inspired by a Victorian townhouse on South Street, Philadelphia, PA, ZONING is an architectural font that remains true to its late seventeenth century root Queen Anne values of picturesque coherence and informality. The Aesthetic Movement of the 1890s, which revitalized Philadelphian townhouse design, is apparent in the font’s thinned architectural lines, relative unornamentation, and balanced asymmetries. Form follows function with the lettering’s stacking and gridding capacity: ZONING’s wide range of applicability runs the gamut from  modernized subway design to children’s educational television.</p>

<p>The 4th Annual <a href="https://lesbianswhotech.org/newyork2017/">Lesbians Who Tech + Allies Summit</a> from September 7th-9th, 2017 in New York City brought together over 2,000 lesbians, queer women + allies across all areas of technology.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.asylumconnect.org/">AsylumConnect</a>’s Director of Technology, I was invited to lead a project at the summit’s day-long <strong>Social Good Hackathon</strong>. Our team guided software engineers, UX designers, journalists, students, and nonprofit administrators through this prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Empower persecuted queer populations to seek asylum in the U.S.</strong></p>

  <p>Thousands ​of LGBTQ immigrants and asylum seekers come to the U.S. every year, fleeing persecution based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Yet even upon arrival, they often struggle to meet fundamental human needs. AsylumConnect is a nonprofit that helps queer asylum seekers find lifesaving resources. Help us ideate ways to better serve our population, from amplifying their voices to safely integrating into local communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We educated hackathon attendees about the plight of LGBTQ asylum seekers in the United States, led a collective brainstorming session around organizationally identified challenges, and facilitated the hackathon team in building their project.</p>

<p>The team we led placed second with <strong>AsylumConnect Community</strong>, a social extension to the <a href="http://www.asylumconnectcatalog.org/">AsylumConnect resource catalog</a> that aimed to provide asylum seekers with a sense of psychological safety, security, and community.</p>

<h2 id="product-design">Product Design</h2>

<p>At the start of my internship, SHIFTSPACE had installed a temporary construction fence around Philadelphia’s 30th St Station that consisted of a series of metal planter units:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/shiftspace-30th-fence-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>These metal units absorbed heat under the summer sun, creating an inhospitable plant environment. I worked with a team of two other interns to redesign the planter units, conducting materials research and iterating on product designs. Our final design used locally-sourced fabric that was heat-resistant, compatible with irrigation systems and easier to install.</p>

<p>Our product was brought to market following the conclusion of my internship. In 2016, our redesigned vertical planters were installed inside 30th St Station in partnership with Amtrak and University City District. The Amtrak Gardens installation was a key element in welcoming the 2016 Democratic National Convention to Philadelphia.</p>

<p><em>Submitted to the Department of Computer and Information Science in fulfillment of the Senior Capstone Thesis for the degree of BAS in Computer Science (ASCS) at the University of Pennsylvania.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
  <p>The ubiquity of computing technologies has revolutionized not only our global social consciousness, but also our collective abilities to innovate for socioeconomic impact. The past eight years have seen an unprecedented swell of interest in developing technologies to uplift marginalized, underserved or underrepresented communities. Yet while good intentions and technical expertise can serve as catalysts of revolutionary innovation, there is a unique set of concerns involved in designing technology solutions for disadvantaged populations. This paper strives to investigate those considerations and synthesize concrete suggestions for how to “do good” well.</p>

  <p>In this thesis, I first summarize the rise of interest in leveraging computer technologies for social good and their potential for accelerating socioeconomic growth in disadvantaged communities. In recognizing the human vulnerabilities exposed by such endeavors, I draw attention to necessary considerations and propose a need for multidisciplinary analysis. Drawing from an existing field of research on the use of information and communication technologies in international development, I advocate for the adoption of human-centered design and community-driven development paradigms. Finally, I present a literature review of best practices for sustainable impact and conclude with a case study describing my experiences designing a technology platform for LGBTQ asylum seekers in the United States.</p>
