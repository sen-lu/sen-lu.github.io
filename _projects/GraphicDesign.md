### Textual Interpretation
#### 2012

> Science is still one of my chief joys. The popularization of science that Isaac Asimov did so well—the communication not just of the findings but of the methods of science—seems to me as natural as breathing. After all, when you’re in love, you want to tell the world.
>
> – Carl Sagan, ["Wonder and Skepticism"][10], Skeptical Inquirer 19 (1), January-February 1995, [ISSN 0194-6730][11]

I transcribed Carl Sagan's ["Wonder and Skepticism"][10] into a textual interpretation, which I printed using laser-cut linoleum blocks on a linotype machine.

As a fun side note, here's an additional excerpt from Sagan's piece:

> There’s another reason I think popularizing science is important, why I try to do it. It’s a foreboding I have—maybe ill-placed—of an America in my children’s generation, or my grandchildren’s generation, when all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when we’re a service and information-processing economy; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest even grasps the issues; when the people (by “the people” I mean the broad population in a democracy) have lost the ability to set their own agendas, or even to knowledgeably question those who do set the agendas; when there is no practice in questioning those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and religiously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in steep decline, unable to distinguish between what’s true and what feels good, we slide, almost without noticing, into superstition and darkness.

This was published in 1995. It's a little terrifying to think about this in context of current events, but also heartening to see how my research interests and skills have grown so organically over the past five years. I feel just as passionate about working to counteract this version of reality, and infinitely more prepared to go out into the world and do it.

### Personal Logo
#### 2012

During a 2012 Graphic Design class at the University of Pennsylvania, I was tasked with creating a personal logo. I first collected **external inspiration**:

Then conducted **internal reflection**:

I integrated this inspiration with my initials (TL) to make the following shape:

While it conveyed the clean, bold aesthetic and sense of movement I was aiming for, it lacked grounding and was too sharp and static. I wanted to impart a sense of continuity, a shape that existed both in and outside of itself. My final product is the personal logo I still use today:

### Font Design

Inspired by a Victorian townhouse on South Street, Philadelphia, PA, ZONING is an architectural font that remains true to its late seventeenth century root Queen Anne values of picturesque coherence and informality. The Aesthetic Movement of the 1890s, which revitalized Philadelphian townhouse design, is apparent in the font’s thinned architectural lines, relative unornamentation, and balanced asymmetries. Form follows function with the lettering’s stacking and gridding capacity: ZONING’s wide range of applicability runs the gamut from  modernized subway design to children’s educational television.

I visually transcribed "The Light" by Blackmill into the paired visual pieces:
